It was late at night, when I had the idea to learn [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) with .NET-Support.

This isn't about copying a complete tutorial, but rather figuring stuff out. Of course I'm using online resources as tutorials, videos and documentation.

After watching wye creating Super Mario World in Godot (https://www.youtube.com/@___wye), I started this project.
